Food serversâ€™ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale, they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the UnitedStates) are a major component of pay.
